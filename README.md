# Deep Equilibrium Models versus Bilevel Learning

This repository contains the code for the paper [Regularization of Inverse Problems: Deep Equilibrium Models versus Bilevel Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01377). Here we compare Bilevel Learning and Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) methods.

The code is based on the paper [Deep Equilibrium Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01377), and in particular to the code which is publicly available [here](http://implicit-layers-tutorial.org/deep_equilibrium_models/).

The current implementation allows training on either MNIST or CelebA datasets. To start, select the folder with the dataset you want to run (more instructions are included inside each folder).
